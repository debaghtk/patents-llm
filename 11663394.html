        <title>US Patent for Systems for generating instances of variable fonts Patent (Patent #  11,663,394 issued May 30, 2023) - Justia Patents Search</title>
            <meta  name="description" content="In implementations of systems for generating instances of variable fonts, a computing device implements a similarity system to receive input data describing attribute values of glyphs of an input font. The similarity system generates a custom instance of a variable font by modifying a value of a registered design axis of the variable font based on the attribute values. A similarity score is determined that describes a visual similarity between the custom instance of the variable font and the input font. The similarity system identifies an additional design axis of the variable font based on the similarity score and generates an instance of the variable font that is visually similar to the input font by modifying a value of the additional design axis.">

                    <p>In implementations of systems for generating instances of variable fonts, a computing device implements a similarity system to receive input data describing attribute values of glyphs of an input font.

A similarity score is determined that describes a visual similarity between the custom instance of the variable font and the input font.

             <strong class="heading-4">RELATED APPLICATIONS</strong> <p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/942,286, filed Jul. 29, 2020, entitled “Systems for Generating Instances of Variable Fonts,” the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>   <strong class="heading-4">BACKGROUND</strong> <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Text is one of the most important tools available to digital artists because it is usable to simultaneously convey a message based on a substance of the text and propagate a theme or a brand based on a visual appearance of the text. Digital content creation systems render glyphs of text using different fonts to change the visual appearance of the text depicted in digital content. In some scenarios, it is desirable to identify fonts based on a visual appearance of glyphs rendered using the fonts such as to identify fonts which are visually similar to a particular font. For example, the particular font may be a custom font which is not widely available. In this example, a digital artist desires a font that is visually similar to the particular font.</p> <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional systems display multiple indications of fonts which are visually similar to the particular font, for example, to indicate available visually similar fonts if the particular font is not available. These visually similar fonts are determined based on similarity scores calculated from Euclidean distances between feature vector representations of the fonts. For example, if Euclidean distances are relatively small for feature vectors corresponding to first and second fonts, then the first font and the second font have a high similarity score and the first and second fonts are visually similar. Alternatively, if Euclidean distances are relatively large for the feature vectors corresponding to the first and second fonts, then the first font and the second font have a low similarity score and the first and second fonts are not visually similar.</p> <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional systems, however, are not capable of identifying instances of variable fonts that are visually similar to the particular font. A variable font is a type of font that has a visual appearance which is changeable by modifying a value of a design axis of the variable font. For example, the variable font includes a default or a named instance and increasing and/or decreasing the value of the design axis generates instances of the variable font which are visually distinct from the default instance. Many variable fonts include multiple design axes such that each value of each design axis corresponds to a unique instance of the variable font. Because a single variable font is usable to generate a multitude of visually distinct instances of the single variable font, there is no specific instance of the variable font that is representative of the variable font for calculating a similarity score, for example, based on Euclidean distances.</p> <strong class="heading-4">SUMMARY</strong> <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems and techniques are described for generating instances of variable fonts. In one example, a computing device implements a similarity system to automatically generate an instance of a variable font that is visually similar to an input font. For example, the similarity system receives input data describing attribute values of glyphs of the input font. The similarity system generates a custom instance of the variable font by modifying a value of a design axis of the variable font based on the attribute values of the glyphs of the input font.</p> <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A similarity score is determined that describes a visual similarity between the custom instance of the variable font and the input font. The similarity system identifies an additional design axis of the variable font based on the similarity score.

These similarity scores are calculated from Euclidean distances between feature vector representations of the fonts. It is not possible to represent a variable font as a feature vector for comparison with a feature vector representation of another font. This is because the variable font is representative of a variety of visually distinct potential instances of the variable font.</p> <p id="p-0020" num="0019">Because conventional systems identify similar fonts by comparing feature vectors of the fonts, the conventional systems would require a feature vector representation of every possible instance of a variable font in order to determine if any of these instances are visually similar to an input font. Since a single variable font includes a theoretically unlimited number of unique instances, identifying a particular instance which is visually similar to the input font is impractical or impossible using conventional techniques.</p> <p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to overcome these limitations, systems and techniques are described for generating instances of variable fonts. In an example, a computing device implements a similarity system to automatically generate an instance of a variable font that is visually similar to an input font. For example, the similarity system receives input data describing attribute values of glyphs of the input font.</p> <p id="p-0022" num="0021">The attribute values of the glyphs of the input font define visual features of these glyphs such as glyph weight, width, slant, optical size, and so forth. The similarity system processes variable font data describing a variable font and identifies a design axis of the variable font. In one example, the design axis is a registered design axis of the variable font such as an Italic axis, an Optical Size axis, a Slant axis, a Width axis, a Weight axis, and so forth. The similarity system determines a relationship between values of the design axis of the variable font and attribute values of glyphs rendered using instances of the variable font. The similarity system uses this relationship to identify a value of the design axis which corresponds to an attribute value of the glyphs of the input font.</p> <p id="p-0023" num="0022">The similarity system applies the identified value to the design axis and generates a first custom instance of the variable font. For example, glyphs rendered using the first custom instance have the attribute value of the glyphs of the input font. A first similarity score is determined that describes a visual similarity between the first custom instance of the variable font and the input font. The similarity system identifies an additional design axis of the variable font based on a correlation between values of the additional design axis and the first similarity score. In one example, the similarity system identifies the additional design axis from a plurality of other additional design axes as having axis values expected to affect the first similarity score to a greater degree than axis values of the plurality of other additional design axes. In this example, the similarity system selects the additional design axis as having a higher absolute value of correlation with the first similarity score than the plurality of other additional design axes.</p> <p id="p-0024" num="0023">The similarity system generates the instance of the variable font that is visually similar to the input font by modifying a value of the additional design axis. For example, the similarity system generates a second custom instance of the variable font using a median value of the additional design axis. A second similarity score is determined between the second custom instance of the variable font and the input font. The similarity system then uses a value of the additional design axis to a right of the median value and generates a third custom instance of the variable font.</p> <p id="p-0025" num="0024">A third similarity score is determined between the third custom instance of the variable font and the input font. If the third similarity score is greater than the second similarity score, then the similarity system continues evaluating values further to the right of the median value in this manner until a value of the additional design axis is identified which corresponds to a maximum similarity score. If the third similarity score is not greater than the second similarity score, then the similarity system evaluates values of the additional design axis to a left of the median value until the value is identified that corresponds to the maximum similarity score. The similarity system generates an instance of the variable font using the first custom instance and the value of the additional design axis corresponding to the maximum similarity score as the instance of the variable font that is visually similar font to the input font.</p> <p id="p-0026" num="0025">By generating instances of variable fonts in this manner, the described systems are capable of generating instances of a single variable font which are visually similar to multiple different input fonts. These visually similar fonts are usable in addition to the input fonts or in place of the input fonts. In this manner, the described systems can reduce computing resource consumption by representing multiple different input fonts using instances of a single variable font. For example, a single variable font file is usable to replace font files of multiple input fonts. Thus, a font file repository having many font files of different fonts is replaceable with a repository having a few variable font files and/or a single variable font file.</p> <strong class="heading-4">Term Examples</strong> <p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term “variable font” refers to a font that supports multiple font faces along at least one design axis.</p> <p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term “design axis” refers to an axis of a variable font having a range of values which may be adjusted to modify an attribute of glyphs rendered using an instance of the variable font. By way of example, a design axis may be registered or unregistered. Examples of registered design axes include Italic, Optical Size, Slant, Width, Weight, etc. Examples of unregistered design axes include Serif, xHeight, Ascent, Descent, and so forth.</p> <p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term “attribute” of a glyph refers to a visual feature of the glyph. Examples of attributes include weight, width, slant, optical size, etc.</p> <p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term “instance” of a variable font refers to a font face corresponding to a particular position in a design-variation space of the variable font. By way of example, the font face of an instance of a variable font is usable to render glyphs of the variable font.</p> <p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term “master” refers to a set of source font data that includes complete outline data for a particular font face.</p> <p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are also described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.</p> <strong class="heading-4">Example Environment</strong> <p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <strong>1</strong></figref> is an illustration of an environment <strong>100</strong> in an example implementation that is operable to employ digital systems and techniques as described herein. The illustrated environment <strong>100</strong> includes a computing device <strong>102</strong> connected to a network <strong>104</strong>. The computing device <strong>102</strong> is configurable as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device (e.g., assuming a handheld configuration such as a tablet or mobile phone), and so forth. Thus, the computing device <strong>102</strong> may range from a full resource device with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and/or processing resources (e.g., mobile devices). Additionally, the computing device <strong>102</strong> can be representative of a plurality of different devices, such as multiple servers utilized by a business to perform operations “over the cloud.”</p> <p id="p-0034" num="0033">The illustrated environment <strong>100</strong> also includes a display device <strong>106</strong> that is communicatively coupled to the computing device <strong>102</strong> via a wired or a wireless connection. A variety of device configurations are usable to implement the computing device <strong>102</strong> and/or the display device <strong>106</strong>. The computing device <strong>102</strong> includes a storage device <strong>108</strong> and similarity module <strong>110</strong>. The storage device <strong>108</strong> is illustrated to include variable font data <strong>112</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0035" num="0034">The variable font data <strong>112</strong> describes a plurality of variable fonts available to the similarity module <strong>110</strong>. For example, the variable font data <strong>112</strong> includes a font file for each of the plurality of variable fonts. These font files define design axes used by the variable fonts, adjustable ranges of the design axes, default or named instances of the variable fonts, and so forth.</p> <p id="p-0036" num="0035">The similarity module <strong>110</strong> is illustrated as having, receiving, and/or transmitting input data <strong>114</strong>. The input data <strong>114</strong> describes glyphs of an input font <strong>116</strong>. In one example, the input data <strong>114</strong> includes a digital image depicting glyphs rendered using the input font <strong>116</strong>. In this example, the input font <strong>116</strong> may or may not be available to the similarity module <strong>110</strong>. In an example, the input data <strong>114</strong> includes an electronic document having glyphs of text rendered using the input font <strong>116</strong>. In another example, the input data <strong>114</strong> includes a font file corresponding to the input font <strong>116</strong>. The input font <strong>116</strong> may be a non-variable font or an instance of a variable font.</p> <p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> processes the input data <strong>114</strong> to determine attributes of glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. In some examples, these attributes include a weight or a thickness of a stem of a glyph of the input font <strong>116</strong>. In one example, the attributes of the glyphs include a width or a distance between origins of consecutive glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. For example, the attributes of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong> include a slant or an angle between a vertical stem of a glyph and a y-axis of the glyph's bounding box.</p> <p id="p-0038" num="0037">The similarity module <strong>110</strong> also processes the variable font data <strong>112</strong> and identifies a design axis of a variable font such that values of the design axis are proportional to an attribute of glyphs of the variable font. To define a relationship between the design axis values and values of the attribute, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines attribute values of glyphs of a default or a named instance of the variable font. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> also determines a value or values of the design axis for the default instance of the variable font. By comparing the values of the design axis and corresponding values of the attribute of the glyphs, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> derives the relationship between the design axis values and the attribute values for the variable font.</p> <p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines whether the variable font uses a registered design axis such as an Italic axis, an Optical Size axis, a Slant axis, a Width axis, and/or a Weight axis. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> derives a relationship between registered axis values and corresponding glyph attributes for each registered design axis used by the variable font. Consider an example in which the variable font uses the Weight axis and the similarity module <strong>110</strong> derives a relationship between the Weight axis values and values of weights of glyphs of instances of the variable font. In this example, the vertical stem thickness or the weight of a glyph of the variable font is directly proportional to the values of the Weight axis. This relationship is also a function of a number of masters included in the variable font. For example, if the variable font includes multiple masters, then the relationship between the values of the Weight axis and the weights of the glyphs may be defined by multiple linear equations.</p> <p id="p-0040" num="0039">The similarity module <strong>110</strong> leverages the relationship between design axis values and the attribute values of the glyphs of the variable font to identify a design axis value that corresponds to an attribute value of the input font <strong>116</strong>. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> applies the identified design axis value to the variable font and generates an instance of the variable font that is visually similar to the input font <strong>116</strong>. Consider the previous example in which the similarity module <strong>110</strong> derives the relationship between the values of the Weight axis and the weights of the glyphs of the variable font. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines that glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong> have a particular weight or vertical stem thickness. In this example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> uses the relationship between the Weight axis values and the weights of the glyphs of the variable font to identify a value of the Weight axis which corresponds to the particular weight of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> uses the identified Weight axis value to generate an instance of the variable font with glyphs that also have the particular weight of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the previous example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> uses the relationship between the values of the Weight axis and the weights of the glyphs of the variable font to generate the instance of the variable font having glyphs with weights based on weights of glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. Thus, the generated instance of the variable font is visually similar to the input font <strong>116</strong> because the glyphs of the generated instance of the variable font have the weights of the glyphs rendered using the input font <strong>116</strong>. In one example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines a similarity score between the generated instance of the variable font and the input font <strong>116</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0042" num="0041">To do so, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> generates or receives a latent representation of the input font <strong>116</strong> and a latent representation of the generated instance of the variable font. In an example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> generates the latent representations of the input font <strong>116</strong> and the generated instance of the variable font using one or more convolutional neural networks. From these latent representations, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> extracts a feature vector describing a visual appearance of the input font <strong>116</strong> and a feature vector describing a visual appearance of the generated instance of the variable font. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines the similarity score by calculating a Euclidean distance between the feature vectors. In one example, a relatively small Euclidean distance corresponds to a relatively high similarity score whereas a relatively large Euclidean distance between the feature vectors corresponds to a relatively low similarity score.</p> <p id="p-0043" num="0042">Continuing the previous example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines that the variable font also uses the Width axis. In this continued example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines that the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong> have a particular width by processing the input data <strong>114</strong>. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> also determines a relationship between values of the Width axis and widths of the glyphs of instances of the variable font. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> is implemented leverage the relationship between the values of the Width axis and corresponding widths of glyphs of instances of the variable font to identify a value of the Width axis corresponding to the particular width of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> uses the identified value of the Width axis to generate an instance of the variable font such that glyphs of the instance of the variable font have the particular width of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. In this example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> applies the identified value of the Width axis to the instance of the variable font having glyphs with weights based on the weights of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. Thus, the generated instance of the variable font in this example has glyphs with weights based on weights of glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong> and also has glyphs with widths based on widths of glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>. For example, the generated instance of the variable font has glyphs with the particular weight and the particular width of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0045" num="0044">Continuing this example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> determines that the variable font also uses the Slant axis. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> processes the input data <strong>114</strong> and determines that the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong> have a particular slant. The similarity module <strong>110</strong> also derives a relationship between values of the Slant axis and slants of glyphs of instances of the variable font. For example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> leverages the relationship between the values of the Slant axis and corresponding slants of glyphs of instances of the variable font to identify a value of the Slant axis corresponding to the particular slant of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>.</p> <p id="p-0046" num="0045">The similarity module <strong>110</strong> uses the identified value of the Slant axis to generate an instance of the variable font such that the glyphs of the instance of the variable font have the particular slant of the glyphs of the input font <strong>116</strong>.

For example, the similarity module <strong>110</strong> generates the instance of the variable font that is visually similar to the input font.</p> <p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <strong>7</strong></figref> illustrates an example <strong>700</strong> of a user interface <strong>702</strong> in which instances of variable fonts are identified as being visually similar to an input font <strong>704</strong>. As shown in the example <strong>700</strong>, glyphs of the input font <strong>704</strong> are rendered in the user interface <strong>702</strong>. An indication of a similar font <strong>706</strong> is displayed in a menu of the user interface <strong>702</strong> which identifies the similar font as being visually similar to the input font <strong>704</strong>. An indication of an instance of a variable font <strong>708</strong> is also displayed in the menu of the user interface <strong>702</strong> which identifies the instance of the variable font as being visually similar to the input font <strong>704</strong>. In this example, the instance of the variable font is usable in place of the similar font or in addition to the similar font.</p> <p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in the example <strong>700</strong>, instances of variable fonts are displayed as visually similar fonts to a particular font. The particular font can be a variable font or a non-variable font. As shown, an instance of a locally available variable font is used render glyphs that are visually similar to glyphs rendered using the particular font, for example, if another font that is visually similar to the particular font is not available locally to the computing device <strong>102</strong>. For example, instances of variable fonts are associated with other fonts as being visually similar to the other fonts. These instances of variable fonts are usable in addition to the other fonts, in place of the other fonts, and so forth.</p> <strong class="heading-4">Example System and Device</strong> <p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <strong>8</strong></figref> illustrates an example system <strong>800</strong> that includes an example computing device that is representative of one or more computing systems and/or devices that may implement the various techniques described herein.
